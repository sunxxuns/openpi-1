do not reinstall pytorch, as the default pytorch is working for current hw.
the purpose is to get the amd perf compared with h200 (in h200-bench branch done on another machine)
the targeted workload pi cares is the bench of full inference policy,
previous work was done on mi350 (gfx950) machine on amd-bench branch, machine was cutoff
now working on mi300 (gfx942) machine on mi300-bench branch
